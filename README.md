Creating an interface for the Coding Ninjas placement cell to keep records of students and schedule interviews with different companies requires several components. To build this system, you can consider using a web-based application as it provides a user-friendly interface accessible from anywhere. Below, I'll outline the key features and functionalities of the interface:
